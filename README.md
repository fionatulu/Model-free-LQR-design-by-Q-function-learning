# Model-free-LQR-design-by-Q-function-learning
This repository contains the implementation and reproduction of the findings from the paper titled "Model-free LQR design by Q-function learning". The goal of this project is to verify the results and methodology presented in the original research.

## Implementation Files
This repository contains the following matlab scripts:
- main.m: The main script implementing the model free LQR design algorithm.
Moreover, the experiment is applied to the system 9 defined in Table 1 of the original paper, system matrix is set as defined in Table 9.
- drawfig.mat: The script for drawing result figure.
